## FEATURE:

All-in-One ERP System for Company Operations

This ERP is designed as a modular, cloud-first platform that unifies all critical company processes in one environment. Unlike older, overly complex ERPs, this system focuses on simplicity, automation, and adaptability. Each module can stand alone or integrate seamlessly with others, so the company can start small and grow the system as needs expand.

Key pillars of the ERP:

Integration-first: Works natively with e-commerce, banking, POS, and external APIs.

Automation-heavy: Reduces manual data entry with AI-assisted workflows.

User-focused design: Minimal, mobile-ready, bilingual (Thai/English), and role-based dashboards for clarity.

Scalable: From small business to enterprise without system migration.

## EXAMPLES:

[Provide and explain examples that you have in the `examples/` folder]

## DOCUMENTATION:

[List out any documentation (web pages, sources for an MCP server like Crawl4AI RAG, etc.) that will need to be referenced during development]

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

[Any other considerations or specific requirements - great place to include gotchas that you see AI coding assistants miss with your projects a lot]
