## FEATURE:

All-in-One ERP System for Company Operations

This ERP is designed as a modular, cloud-first platform that unifies all critical company processes in one environment. Unlike older, overly complex ERPs, this system focuses on simplicity, automation, and adaptability. Each module can stand alone or integrate seamlessly with others, so the company can start small and grow the system as needs expand.

Key pillars of the ERP:

Integration-first: Works natively with e-commerce, banking, POS, and external APIs.

Automation-heavy: Reduces manual data entry with AI-assisted workflows.

User-focused design: Minimal, mobile-ready, bilingual (Thai/English), and role-based dashboards for clarity.

Scalable: From small business to enterprise without system migration.

### Goal
Build a modular ERP system tailored to our company’s needs, covering Finance, Inventory, HR, and Sales.  
The system should be **scalable**, **modular**, and **easy to extend**.

### Core Modules
1. **Finance**
   - Track income, expenses, profit/loss
   - Generate invoices & payment records
   - Automated monthly/annual reports

2. **Inventory**
   - Stock tracking with minimum level alerts
   - Real-time updates from sales and purchases
   - Barcode/QR integration for quick scanning

3. **HR**
   - Employee onboarding and record management
   - Attendance and leave tracking
   - Payroll integration with Finance

4. **Sales**
   - Customer CRM (basic contact + history)
   - Order management (quotes → invoice → delivery)
   - Sales performance dashboards

### Constraints
- Should be modular (each part can work independently but integrates smoothly).
- Web-based first (desktop + mobile responsive).
- Scalable database design.
- Integration-ready (APIs for third-party tools).
- Low barrier for non-technical staff to use.

### Success Criteria
- Internal team can manage daily operations without manual spreadsheets.
- Dashboards provide real-time visibility.
- Reduces repetitive admin tasks by at least 40%.

## DOCUMENTATION:

[List out any documentation (web pages, sources for an MCP server like Crawl4AI RAG, etc.) that will need to be referenced during development]

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

[Any other considerations or specific requirements - great place to include gotchas that you see AI coding assistants miss with your projects a lot]
